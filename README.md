This mod will enlarge the advancements info UI, so it'll use most of your screen, not just a tiny part of it, especially when your GUI scale is high.

This means more info visible at the same time, less scrolling, and a better overview.

Also, it checks out which requirements you've met and which you haven't, and displays a list of those to the right of the UI. This makes it much easier to find what you have done and what you still need to do.

For example, the "Discover every Biome" Advancement doesn't tell you what's still missing; this mod will help you go for that last biome you haven't visited.

This works with data pack Advancements as well; here's an example from BlazeAndCave:

If the list to the right overflows, you can use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll.

Advancements, and their objectives, have their very own names, which may or may not correspond to MineCraft items, blocks, or entities. The mod tries its best to map those names to Minecraft objects, but in some cases, especially with Data Packs, that's just not possible. The mod will show the internal name in that case in the hope you're better at deciphering what's needed than the mod itself. 

For example, the objective of "The Parrots and the Bats" is named "bred", this will show as bred in the info box. 


This is the very first version of the mod, and as such, there are probably still bugs. Please report them!
